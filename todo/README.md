# To Do Website

Creating this To-Do website is a great way for me to relearn the most important things I need to know to work with JavaScript. It’s a starting point for learning CRUD operations. In this project, I will be handling everything—from the front-end to the back-end. The website will be designed to interact with users, and I’ll also use local storage to keep data on the user's computer, allowing them to come back at any time and pick up where they left off.

# CRUD

- **Create** tasks (add new to-do items).
- **Read** tasks (display tasks).
- **Update** tasks (mark as completed and/or edit tasks).
- **Delete** tasks (remove completed or unnecessary tasks).

# Front-End and Back-End Integration

- Front-End: On the front-end, you get to practice creating dynamic user interfaces, updating the DOM (Document Object Model) with JavaScript, and implementing interactive features like checkboxes, buttons, and input fields.
- Back-End: On the back-end, you’ll learn to handle requests, work with a database (for storing tasks), and implement business logic. This is important for building full-stack applications, where the front-end and back-end need to communicate with each other.

# Development

- You can build a To-Do list app using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Future development I can use React.
- Local Storage helps storing data and being able to retreave that data via JSON.
